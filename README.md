# RDP-Line-Simplification-Algorithm
A visualization of the RDP line simplification algorithm.

This allgorithm is used to simplify a curve defined by a set of points into a curve defined by fewer points.
It's used in AI and robotics to reduce a set of complicated data so it can be processed easily.
Algorithm taken from [wiki](https://github.com/M-Haider-Rauf/RDP-Line-Simplification-Algorithm.git).
